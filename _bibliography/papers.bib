  abstract = {While classical data analysis has addressed observations that are real numbers or elements of a real vector space, at present many statistical problems of high interest in the sciences address the analysis of data that consist of more complex objects, taking values in spaces that are naturally not (Euclidean) vector spaces but which still feature some geometric structure. Manifold fitting is a long-standing problem, and has finally been addressed in recent years by  Fefferman et. al (\cite{fefferman2020reconstruction,fefferman2021reconstruction}).
  We develop a method with a theory guarantee that fits a $d$-dimensional underlying manifold from noisy observations sampled in the ambient space $\mathbb{R}^D$. The new approach uses geometric structures to obtain the manifold estimator in the form of image sets via a two-step mapping approach. 
  We prove that, under certain mild assumptions and with a sample size $N=\mathcal{O}(\sigma^{-(d+3)})$, these estimators are true $d$-dimensional smooth manifolds whose estimation error, as measured by the Hausdorff distance, is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(\sigma^2\log(1/\sigma))$ with high probability. Compared with the existing approaches proposed in \cite{fefferman2018fitting, fefferman2021fitting, genovese2014nonparametric, yao2019manifold}, our method exhibits superior efficiency while attaining very low error rates with a significantly reduced sample size, which scales polynomially in $\sigma^{-1}$ and exponentially in $d$. Extensive simulations are performed to validate our theoretical results. Our findings are relevant to various fields involving high-dimensional data in machine learning. Furthermore, our method opens up new avenues for existing non-Euclidean statistical methods in the sense that it has the potential to unify them to analyze data on manifolds in the ambience space domain.}

  abstract = {Manifold fitting, which offers substantial potential for efficient and accurate modeling, poses a critical challenge in nonlinear data analysis. This study presents an approach that employs neural networks to fit the latent manifold. Leveraging the generative adversarial framework, this method learns smooth mappings between low-dimensional latent space and high-dimensional ambient space, echoing the Riemannian exponential and logarithmic maps. The well-trained neural networks provide estimations for the latent manifold, facilitate data projection onto the manifold, and even generate data points that reside directly within the manifold. Through an extensive series of simulation studies and real data experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our approach in capturing the inherent structure of the underlying manifold within the ambient space data. Notably, our method exceeds the computational efficiency limitations of previous approaches and offers control over the dimensionality and smoothness of the resulting manifold. This advancement holds significant potential in the fields of statistics and computer science. The seamless integration of powerful neural network architectures with generative adversarial techniques unlocks possibilities for manifold fitting, thereby enhancing data analysis. The implications of our findings span diverse applications, from dimensionality reduction and data visualization to generating authentic data. Collectively, our research paves the way for future advancements in nonlinear data analysis and offers a beacon for subsequent scholarly pursuits.}}
