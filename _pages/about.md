I am Su Jiaji (苏佳骥), a freshman in the statistical research community.

Currently I hold a position as a research fellow in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/) at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) (NUS). My academic journey at NUS began in August 2018, culminating in a Ph.D. in Statistics in January 2024 under the guidance of associate professor [Zhigang YAO](https://zhigang-yao.github.io/index.html). Prior to my journey in Singapore, I earned a B.S. in Statistics from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2018. For additional details about my academic and professional journey, please refer to <a href="/cv/">my CV</a>.

My research primarily focuses on statistical inference related to singularities, including manifold fitting in Euclidean spaces, real data dimension reduction, and solving ill-posed inverse problems. In addition, I have a keen interest in machine learning, particularly in the theoretical and practical applications of neural networks.
