My Chinese name is 苏佳骥. I am currently serving as a research fellow in the [Department of Statistics and Data Science](https://www.stat.nus.edu.sg/) at the [National University of Singapore](https://www.nus.edu.sg/) (NUS). I have been to NUS since August 2018, and received my Ph.D. in Statistics here in Jan 2024, under the guidance of associate professor [Zhigang YAO](https://zhigang-yao.github.io/index.html). Prior to my journey in Singapore, I completed my B.S. in Statistics from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) in 2018. For additional details about my academic and professional journey, please refer to <a href="/cv/">my CV</a>.

My main interest is in statistical inference with singularity, including but not limited to manifold fitting in Euclidean spaces, real data dimension reduction, and ill-posed inverse problems. Apart from that, I am also interested in machine learning, especially neural networks, from both theory and application aspects.
